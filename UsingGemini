# Getting Started with Gemini

I had a basic understanding of what I wanted to do thanks to the guided practice
I did on Coursera. Just for my own peace of mind, I still prompted:
> Hello. I'm doing some practice for my product manager homework. 
> Can you help me with some mock market research?

After I was reassured that helping with market reasearch was indeed a
possibility with more context, I informed Gemini that I wanted to focus on apples
because it is something that I'm comfortable with.

Gemini immediately set up a scenario:
> ## Mock Market Research Scenario: The Premium Apple Consumer
> ### Product: A new, premium, pre-selected Apple Discovery Box subscription. 
> This box is delivered monthly, featuring 3-4 unique, often heirloom or 
> specialty, apple varieties sourced directly from local, high-end orchards, 
> along with tasting notes and suggested pairings (e.g., cheese, cider, spices). 
> ### Target Market: Affluent Millennial and Gen Z households (ages 25-45) in a 
> major metropolitan area who self-identify as "foodies," shop at upscale or 
> organic grocery stores (like Whole Foods or local farmers' markets), 
> and are willing to pay a premium for quality, novelty, and convenience.
> ### Market Research Goal: Gauge consumer interest, willingness-to-pay (WTP), 
> and identify the key value proposition for this premium apple subscription 
> service to inform pricing and marketing strategy.
