# Market Research Survey
For the initial discovery phase of market research, Gemini proposed a consumer survey that only asked 4 questions:

## Original Proposed Questions
**1. Current Buying Behavior:** On average, how often do you currently buy apples, and what factors primarily influence your purchase decision? (e.g., price, variety, organic status, intended use like snacking/baking).

**2. Pain Point Analysis:** Which of the following describes the biggest challenge you have when buying specialty produce, like apples?
- A) Not knowing which new varieties to try.
- B) Difficulty finding truly high-quality, fresh-off-the-tree apples.
- c) The hassle of sourcing a variety of specific types from different stores.
- D) I have no significant challenges.

**3. Value Proposition Testing:** How appealing is the idea of a curated monthly box that introduces you to unique, high-quality, specialty apple varieties you may have never tried before? (Scale of 1-5, with 5 being "Extremely Appealing").

**4. Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) Testing (Van Westendorp Method):** Considering a box containing 3-4 unique, high-quality apple varieties (about $\text{4-5}$ lbs total), please specify:
- A) At what price would you consider this box to be too expensive to buy?
- B) At what price would you consider this box to be a bargain (so cheap that you'd question the quality)?

## Amended Survey
However, I didn't think that this survey provided enough information or data. I told Gemini that I think it would be smart to include a question that asks what type of apple the customer regularly buys, whether that be honeycrisp, cosmic crisp, gala, fuji, granny smith, red delicious, autumn glory, etc., and to allow the consumer to be able to check off as many apples as they want/need. There should also be a question asking what the 'job' (intention) is in mind for the apples. There could be a question asking about which type of specialty/novelty/unique apples consumers have heard of.

With my input, Gemini constructed an improved mock survey that provides more background data. If you are at all interested in seeing what was created, or even participating, please click on the link to my Excel spreadsheet üòä

I will also place the survey in a Markdown file.
