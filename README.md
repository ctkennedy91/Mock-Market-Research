# Mock Market Research üçéüçé
This is essentially practice for me, because I had no experience with market research before pursuing my product management certificate. 
In this project, I chose to go with apples because I currently work in a produce department, 
it's something that I'm very familiar and comfortable with, and it's getting to be apple season. Plus, apples are yummy.
I got the inspiration from doing a guided project on Coursera. However, that project focused on the pharmaceutical industry and cancer drugs, which the instructor 
was extremely well versed, informed, and educated in the field. I know every little about that industry and chose to go with something I know far more about. 
The guided project also used ChatGPT. I personally prefer to use Google Gemini, which is what I will be using in this mock market research.
